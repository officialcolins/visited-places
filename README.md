## ðŸ§ª Test-Driven Development

We used **TDD** to build the business logic for `Place` and `TravelLog` classes.

### âœ… Test 1: Create Place object

```javascript
// Test
const place = new Place("Paris", ["Eiffel Tower"], "Summer 2023", "Amazing trip!");
console.assert(place.location === "Paris", "Test 1 Failed: Place location should be Paris");
